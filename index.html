      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Hurricanes pose a significant threat to communities across the United States, especially those in the Southeast
        â€” which is highly vulnerable due to its coastal geography, frequent intense storms, and limited resources in
        many communities for effective mitigation and infrastructure upgrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hurricane risks are exacerbated by inadequate preparedness, outdated hazard maps, and variability in local
        governance and resource allocation. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and disaster mitigation efforts
        offer crucial mechanisms for mitigating these risks by enabling property owners to purchase insurance and
        incentivizing communities to adopt resilience measures through the Community Rating System (CRS). However,
        disparities in CRS ratings and the frequency of hazard map updates suggest gaps in preparedness, leaving
        residents in vulnerable regions underinsured and at greater risk of financial loss.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are CRS Ratings?</h2>
      <p>
        The Community Rating System (CRS) is a FEMA initiative under the NFIP that encourages communities to exceed
        minimum disaster preparedness standards. Communities earn a CRS class rating between 1 (highest) and 9 (lowest)
        based on their efforts in areas such as public information, hazard mapping, regulation, and damage reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Higher CRS ratings result in greater flood insurance premium discounts for residents:

      <h2>Local Governance</h2>
      <p>
        FEMA provides funding and technical assistance to communities through programs like the NFIP, hazard mitigation
        grants, and disaster relief. However, the effectiveness of these funds depends on how well local governments
        apply for and manage the resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Funding Distribution:</strong> FEMA funding often requires local governments to provide matching funds
        or meet specific criteria, which can be challenging for resource-constrained areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Local Governance Variability:</strong> Local governments in the Southeast vary widely in their capacity
        to enforce zoning laws, maintain infrastructure, and participate in programs like the CRS. Smaller or
        under-resourced municipalities may struggle to apply for FEMA grants, update hazard maps, or adopt advanced
        hurricane resilience practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hazard Maps</strong> Hazard maps, created by FEMA, identify areas at high risk for hurricanes and are
        used to set insurance rates and
        guide development decisions. The "Currently Effective Map Date" indicates the last time a community's hazard map
        was updated. Many communities in the Southeast rely on outdated maps that fail to reflect current risks due to
        climate change or urban development. Updating these maps is costly and requires local initiative and funding,
        which some communities lack.

      <h2 style="color: navy">Hurricane Helene</h2>
      <p style="color: navy">
        On September 24, 2024, a catastrophic Category 4 hurricane named Helene struck the state of Florida, leaving
        devastation in its path. Flooding, high winds, rainfall, a storm surge, and dangerous currents ravaged the land
        and communities of Florida, leaving hundreds dead or missing. The storm continued to impact other states,
        including Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. As the Southeast recovers from this
        major tropical storm, questions remain about what causes these powerful cyclones and what can be done to prevent
        them in the future. Below is a visualization of the states impacted by Hurricane Helene in order.

      <h2 style="color: navy">Hurricane Damages</h2>
      <p style="color: navy">
        The need for targeted interventions grows with the escalating frequency and severity of hurricane-related
        damages over the years, particularly in the southeastern states. You can see trends in damage costs, where
        increasingly devastating storms correlate with a rising need for improved disaster
        preparedness and resilience. It also underscores the urgency for updated flood maps, enhanced technical
        assistance, and equitable disaster preparedness practices, especially in high-risk areas that are experiencing
        more frequent and intense storms.

      <h2 style="color: navy">FEMA EMPG State Disparities</h2>
      <p style="color: navy">
        The FEMA Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) provide funding to state, local, tribal, and territorial
        governments to enhance their emergency management systems and capabilities. The grants support activities such
        as planning, training, exercises, and the development of emergency operations centers. EMPG aims to improve
        preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities for all types of hazards, helping communities better manage
        disasters. This visualization shows the total funding amount by state from 2014 to 2023. The visualization
        compares funding levels across states, highlighting if southern states are receiving less support for hurricane
        preparedness, emphasizes that insufficient funding may result in weaker preparedness and response capabilities
        in these hurricane-prone areas, and shows funding disparities - underscoring the potential for greater financial
        vulnerability and slower recovery in underfunded southern states.

      <h2 style="color: navy">Average CRS Class Ratings for Southeastern States</h2>
      <p style="color: navy">
        This visualizes the flood risk management effectiveness
        across the southeast of the country, highlighting variations in communities' preparedness for flood-related
        damage, particularly in hurricane-prone areas. A lower CRS rating indicates poorer floodplain management,
        signaling that some states
        may be inadequately prepared for the impacts of hurricanes and tropical storms. This graph underscores the need
        for targeted interventions, including increased federal support to improve flood resilience, enhanced technical
        assistance for local governments, and greater participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). By
        pinpointing states with low CRS ratings, the graph identifies where focused efforts are most needed to reduce
        vulnerability and strengthen disaster preparedness in the Southeast.

      <h2>So What?</h2>
      <p>
        The combination of low CRS ratings, outdated hazard maps, and inconsistent local governance leaves many
        Southeast communities ill-prepared for hurricanes. Residents face higher insurance premiums, reduced disaster
        resilience,
        and greater financial vulnerability after major storms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      <p>
        Targeted interventions are crucial to addressing the disparities in disaster preparedness and resilience,
        particularly in southeastern states. Increasing federal support for regular flood map updates would provide
        communities with accurate, up-to-date data to better assess flood risks and implement effective floodplain
        management strategies. Enhancing technical assistance for local governments would help them interpret hazard
        maps, adopt best practices for flood mitigation, and increase participation in the National Flood Insurance
        Program (NFIP), ensuring financial preparedness for disasters. Additionally, promoting equitable disaster
        preparedness practices is essential to ensure that marginalized communities, who are often the most vulnerable,
        have access to resources, information, and affordable insurance. These interventions would empower underserved
        populations, helping them better prepare for and recover from hurricane and flood events, while ensuring that
        resilience efforts are inclusive and effective across all communities.
