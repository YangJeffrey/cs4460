      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Hurricanes pose a significant threat to communities across the United States, especially those in the Southeast
        â€” which is highly vulnerable due to its coastal geography, frequent intense storms, and limited resources in
        many communities for effective mitigation and infrastructure upgrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hurricane risks are exacerbated by inadequate preparedness, outdated hazard maps, and variability in local
        governance and resource allocation. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and disaster mitigation efforts
        offer crucial mechanisms for mitigating these risks by enabling property owners to purchase insurance and
        incentivizing communities to adopt resilience measures through the Community Rating System (CRS). However,
        disparities in CRS ratings and the frequency of hazard map updates suggest gaps in preparedness, leaving
        residents in vulnerable regions underinsured and at greater risk of financial loss.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Are CRS Ratings?</h2>
      <p>
        The Community Rating System (CRS) is a FEMA initiative under the NFIP that encourages communities to exceed
        minimum disaster preparedness standards. Communities earn a CRS class rating between 1 (highest) and 9 (lowest)
        based on their efforts in areas such as public information, hazard mapping, regulation, and damage reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Higher CRS ratings result in greater flood insurance premium discounts for residents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Class 1: 45% discount</li>
        <li>Class 9: 5% discount</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Communities with low CRS ratings often lack the resources or technical expertise to implement advanced hurricane
        resilience practices, reducing their residents' eligibility for meaningful insurance discounts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Local Governance</h2>
      <p>
        FEMA provides funding and technical assistance to communities through programs like the NFIP, hazard mitigation
        grants, and disaster relief. However, the effectiveness of these funds depends on how well local governments
        apply for and manage the resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Funding Distribution:</strong> FEMA funding often requires local governments to provide matching funds
        or meet specific criteria, which can be challenging for resource-constrained areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Local Governance Variability:</strong> Local governments in the Southeast vary widely in their capacity
        to enforce zoning laws, maintain infrastructure, and participate in programs like the CRS. Smaller or
        under-resourced municipalities may struggle to apply for FEMA grants, update hazard maps, or adopt advanced
        hurricane resilience practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hazard Maps</strong> Hazard maps, created by FEMA, identify areas at high risk for hurricanes and are
        used to set insurance rates and
        guide development decisions. The "Currently Effective Map Date" indicates the last time a community's hazard map
        was updated. Many communities in the Southeast rely on outdated maps that fail to reflect current risks due to
        climate change or urban development. Updating these maps is costly and requires local initiative and funding,
        which some communities lack.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Implications</h2>
      <p>
        The combination of low CRS ratings, outdated hazard maps, and inconsistent local governance leaves many
        Southeast
        communities ill-prepared for hurricanes. Residents face higher insurance premiums, reduced disaster resilience,
        and greater financial vulnerability after major storms.
      </p>
      <p style="color: red;">
        This underscores the need for targeted interventions, such as increasing federal support for map updates,
        enhancing technical assistance, and promoting equitable disaster preparedness practices.
